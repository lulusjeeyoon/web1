      <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>
        Michelle is a self-taught photographer. Her photographs depict small delights in everyday life.
        Her images are composed of simple forms and pastel like colors. What makes her images so enticing is the use of unusual color composition and juxtaposition of objects and people.
